# **About Me:**

Hello!

My name is Cooper Sanders and I am in the HEDI (Human Experience Design and Interaction) program here at Utah State. I will be a senior this upcoming school year.
I don't have really any experience with Web Development, but I have programmed in Java, C++, and Python. I am looking forward to learning more about Internet Development.

My goal for the class is to create a website that I am excited to display on my portfolio.
